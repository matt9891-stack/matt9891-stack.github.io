## From these two sites, what attributes are you or the viewer examining?

On the Ryanair Fare Finder, it is possible to find different attributes such as locations of origin and possible destination airports, the price of available flights, and date-related variables. 
This allows users to check and evaluate routes not only geographically but also on price. 
In contrast, the easyJet Route Map presents one dominant attribute: the geographic position of destinations and the connections from a selected airport.
Fare information exists on the site but they are not directly shown in the route map visualisation. 

## What type of task abstraction are viewers undertaking on these two websites?

Both websites support travel planning, but they do it in different way. Ryanair’s interface supports decision-making with a particular focus on price comparison. 
Users can identify the cheapest destinations and suitable travel dates, making the task largely analytical and cost-driven. 
The easyJet Route Map supports exploratory tasks, where users can check the available network of destinations and have an overview of where they can travel from a given airport. This type of task is more exploratory and inspirational than analytical.

## How is the data represented – using different marks and channels?

The two websites use different ways to show flight data. Ryanair’s Fare Finder mainly uses text and numbers as visual marks to display destinations and prices, arranged in lists and interface panels. Here, text labels, numerical values, beside the map where destination are displayed as dots, and the position of items in the list act as visual channels that communicate information about where you can fly and how much it costs.
In contrast, easyJet uses a geographic visualisation. Airports are shown as point marks on a map in their real locations, and routes are shown as line marks connecting these points. This design uses the map itself to represent the data.
In both websites, spatial position is an important visual channel.

## Colour schema used

Both the websites are not applying a strong colour schema in its visualisation. Colours are mainly used for general interface purposes such as buttons and highlights rather than to encode categories or numerical values such as price levels. EasyJet’s route map, uses colour categorically and for highlighting. 
Destinations and route connections stand out from the base map, and additional symbols or coloured markers may indicate city–airport relationships or highlighted locations. 
In visualisation design, colour is a visual channel frequently used to distinguish categories or highlight important elements (Yorku.ca, 2014).

## Limitations

Both visualisations have limitations. None of the sites integrates price data into the map, which does not allow to compare spatial and economic information simultaneously. EasyJet requires additional interaction to access fare information, slowing comparison tasks. 

## Strengths
Ryanair’s strength is in its support for decision-making related to cost. Integrating pricing and flexible date options directly answers an important user need when planning travel. 
EasyJet’s strength lies in its spatial clarity and overview of route connectivity, helping users understand the network of available destinations from a departure point. 

## In conclusion
From a visualisation perspective, Ryanair’s interface is more effective for users focused on price comparison and itinerary planning because it foregrounds economically relevant attributes. 
easyJet’s route map can be useful in exploration and destination discovery, as it provides a clear overview of geographic connectivity.
