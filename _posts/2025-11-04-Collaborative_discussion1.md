# Collaborative Discussion

The collaborative discussion has been a valuable learning experience, as it allowed me to compare my research with different perspectives and broaden my understanding of the topic. Engaging with my peers’ contributions helped me see aspects I had not fully considered, particularly regarding the opportunities and challenges of IoT applications. I found the peer's contributions really insightful, emphasising the integration of IoT with advanced tools such as Deep Learning to improve system efficiency and performance. 
In addition, the discussion around the implementation of GDPR principles to reduce risks, mitigate bias, and strengthen ethical data practices added an important governance perspective. 

Overall, the feedback encouraged me to think more critically about ethics, governance and data quality. The exchange of ideas not only strengthened my original analysis but also highlighted the importance of different points of view when facing complex technological topics like IoT.

Below is my initial and Summary Post

# Initial Post

# IoT application – Opportunities and Challenges

The Internet of Things (IoT), defined as a network of connected devices and objects with sensors enabling data collection and sharing (IBM, 2023), has grown quickly due to large internet use. IoT-generated Big Data find applications in sectors such as education, enhancing personalised learning, and applications like smart cities, agriculture, industrial automation, and energy management (IoT and Big Data Technologies: Opportunities and Challenges for Higher Learning, 2020; Abba et al., 2024).
The large use of IoT brings with it both opportunities and challenges. Among the main opportunities, data analytics improves operational efficiency, cost optimisation, and decision-making through real-time insights that enhance agility and resilience of organisations (al., 2023).
However, these benefits come along with some important challenges, including scalability and infrastructure due to the large data volume, and a shortage of internal expertise that can limit full data utilisation. Another major concern is data privacy and ethics as organisations collect personal information, risks of breaches, data theft, and unauthorised access increase, requiring robust security and compliance. Ethical issues such as transparency and algorithmic bias highlight the need to balance innovation with individual rights (al., 2023).
Moreover, managing such a vast amount of data can lead to quality issues, including missing values, formatting inconsistencies, or erroneous entries. Data cleaning is essential to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability by identifying and correcting errors ensuring one of the most important paradigms of Big Data, the veracity. Contextual understanding and visual analysis methods such as boxplots and Q–Q plots, can help the detection of outliers and support the appropriate selection of statistical models. Nevertheless, data cleaning alone cannot eliminate all biases, highlighting the importance of combining technical measures with awareness of the data’s context (Oclc.org, 2025).
In conclusion, while IoT and Big Data offer substantial opportunities to enhance efficiency and personalise services, their potential is mitigated by technical, ethical, and data-quality challenges. Addressing these issues through robust governance, skills development, and careful data management is essential to realise the benefits of IoT-driven analytics fully.

# Summary Post

My initial post emphasises the integration of IoT and Big Data as a pivotal driver of automation and organisational efficiency across industries. Organisations increasingly count on big data analytics to optimise manufacturing and supply chain processes by analysing data collected from IoT platforms and smart sensors. This combination has transformed the Internet of Things into an Internet of Systems, enabling smarter and more interconnected infrastructures (Bhandari, Shrestha and Pradhan, 2024).

As Daniel Eduardo Lopez noted, applications and challenges vary across sectors. In smart agriculture, for instance, IoT systems use optical, location-based, and electromagnetic sensors to monitor factors such as soil moisture and temperature, helping to improve yields, reduce waste, and promote sustainable water and energy use (Afrin et al., 2025).

These systems, however, face challenges due to data drift, caused by environmental changes, sensor ageing, or interference, which can reduce the accuracy of machine-learning models, leading to poor decisions. Security risks, including device disruption, unauthorised access, or manipulation of irrigation and fertilisation systems, also represent an additional risk (Navod Neranjan Thilakarathne et al., 2025).

Other challenges are present in other sectors, such as automotive, where smart sensors enable predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring. Here, reliability is crucial, as data drift or errors can significantly reduce system performance. (TA, 2024)

In both sectors, data validation is an important step as it ensures incoming data meets defined criteria such as acceptable ranges, formats, and logical consistency, with invalid data flagged or removed before further processing, reducing both risk and computational load. Data deduplication removes repeated records from frequent sampling or communication retries, while data normalisation ensures measurements are consistent across devices and platforms for accurate comparison and analysis (Mohammed et al., 2023).

As Syed Mubashir Ali noted, risks must be managed through robust frameworks such as the GDPR, which ensures that personal data, including that collected via IoT devices, is processed ethically and securely. The GDPR imposes strict rules for handling sensitive categories of data, such as ethnic origin, health information, and biometric data, which is particularly important when AI systems are used in sensitive areas like autonomous vehicles (De Luca & Federico, 2025).

In conclusion, integrating IoT and Big Data offers substantial benefits, from improved efficiency to smarter decision-making. At the same time, challenges such as data drift, security threats, and system complexity must be addressed through practices like data validation, deduplication, and normalisation. Regulatory frameworks like the GDPR are essential for ethical and secure data management, supporting organisations in effectively implementing IoT and Big Data while maintaining reliability, safety, and trust
