# Collaborative Discussion 1 – The Data Collection Process

My initial post emphasises the integration of **IoT** and **Big Data** as a pivotal driver of automation and organisational efficiency across industries. Organisations increasingly rely on big data analytics to optimise manufacturing and supply chain processes by analysing data collected from IoT platforms and smart sensors. This combination has transformed the Internet of Things into an **Internet of Systems**, enabling smarter and more interconnected infrastructures (Bhandari, Shrestha & Pradhan, 2024).

As Daniel Eduardo Lopez noted, applications and challenges vary across sectors. In **smart agriculture**, IoT systems use optical, location-based, and electromagnetic sensors to monitor factors such as soil moisture and temperature, helping to improve yields, reduce waste, and promote sustainable water and energy use (Afrin et al., 2025).

These systems, however, face challenges due to **data drift**, caused by environmental changes, sensor ageing, or interference, which can reduce the accuracy of machine-learning models, leading to poor decisions. **Security risks**, including device disruption, unauthorised access, or manipulation of irrigation and fertilisation systems, also represent an additional risk (Navod Neranjan Thilakarathne et al., 2025).

Other challenges are present in sectors like **automotive**, where smart sensors enable predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring. Here, reliability is crucial, as data drift or errors can significantly reduce system performance (TA, 2024).

In both sectors, **data validation** is an important step as it ensures incoming data meets defined criteria such as acceptable ranges, formats, and logical consistency. Invalid data is flagged or removed before further processing, reducing both risk and computational load. **Data deduplication** removes repeated records from frequent sampling or communication retries, while **data normalisation** ensures measurements are consistent across devices and platforms for accurate comparison and analysis (Mohammed et al., 2023).

As Syed Mubashir Ali noted, risks must be managed through robust frameworks such as the **GDPR**, which ensures that personal data, including that collected via IoT devices, is processed ethically and securely. The GDPR imposes strict rules for handling sensitive categories of data, such as ethnic origin, health information, and biometric data, which is particularly important when AI systems are used in sensitive areas like autonomous vehicles (De Luca & Federico, 2025).

**Conclusion:**  
Integrating IoT and Big Data offers substantial benefits, from improved efficiency to smarter decision-making. At the same time, challenges such as data drift, security threats, and system complexity must be addressed through practices like data validation, deduplication, and normalisation. Regulatory frameworks like the GDPR are essential for ethical and secure data management, supporting organisations in effectively implementing IoT and Big Data while maintaining reliability, safety, and trust.
