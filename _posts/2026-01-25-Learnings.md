Throughout the module, I have developed practical skills in data management, particularly in data normalisation, relational database design, and dataset integration.

These skills will be extremely valuable in my career, as I can directly apply the principles of data cleaning and organisation in my work as a reporting analyst.

I also plan to further enhance my expertise by undertaking additional database projects and exploring more advanced SQL techniques. 

I have gained hands-on experience in data science and analytics, using Python for data cleaning, transformation, visualisation, and aggregation.

Moving forward, I aim to work with more complex datasets and apply predictive analysis and statistical modelling. 

In particular, I plan to undertake projects involving machine learning for predicting both categorical and numerical outcomes, utilising libraries such as SciPy and Scikit-learn to improve my practical expertise.

I have learned security principles, backup procedures, and basic computing system concepts, but I will  explore more advanced security techniques and improve my knowledge of system architecture.

In terms of professional, legal, and ethical awareness, I have built a good understanding of GDPR compliance and secure data handling, and I will continue to monitor developments in data protection regulations to ensure my knowledge remains up to date.
