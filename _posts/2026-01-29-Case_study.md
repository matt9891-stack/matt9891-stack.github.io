## 1. Variation of Corporate Tax — What It Means

The chart reveals a striking reality: even though all corporations face the same official statutory tax rate, they do not pay the same effective tax rate.
“Variation” refers to the wide spread in what companies actually pay after deductions, credits, and accounting adjustments. Some firms pay very high effective tax rates. Others pay extremely low rates, sometimes even zero or negative. Most fall somewhere in between.
This spread is the central insight of Bostock’s visualisation. It challenges the assumption that corporate taxation is uniform and shows that real-world tax outcomes differ dramatically across firms.

## 2. Which Companies Tend to Pay Less Tax?

The visualisation highlights patterns among companies with lower effective tax rates.
Technology companies often appear toward the lower end of the spectrum. They benefit from generous R&D tax credits, the ability to hold intellectual property overseas, and strategies that shift profits into low-tax jurisdictions. Their business models, built on intangible assets, make international tax planning easier.
Energy companies, particularly oil and gas firms, also frequently show lower effective rates. This is largely due to capital investment deductions, depletion allowances, and industry-specific tax provisions designed to support energy production.
Companies with extensive foreign operations similarly tend to pay less tax. By shifting profits to countries with lower tax rates, or under pre-2017 U.S. rules delaying taxes on foreign earnings, they significantly reduce their effective burden.
Finally, firms that experienced losses in previous years can carry those losses forward. When they later become profitable, those past losses reduce current tax liabilities, lowering their effective rate.

## 3. Which Companies Tend to Pay More Tax?

At the higher end of the chart are companies with fewer opportunities to minimise tax exposure.
Retailers such as Walmart and Target typically earn most of their profits domestically. Because their operations are concentrated in the U.S., they have fewer opportunities to shift profits internationally. Their tax outcomes often sit closer to the statutory rate.
Domestic service companies show similar patterns. Operating primarily within one country limits access to cross-border tax strategies.
Industries that lack special incentives or credits, including some traditional manufacturing sectors, also tend to pay higher effective rates. Without targeted deductions or credits, their tax burden more closely mirrors the official corporate rate.

## 4. Why Do Effective Tax Rates Differ So Much?

The chart points to several structural reasons behind this variation.
Tax credits and deductions play a major role. R&D credits, renewable energy incentives, accelerated depreciation, and other provisions can significantly reduce taxable income.
Profit shifting allows multinational corporations to record earnings in subsidiaries located in low-tax countries, legally lowering overall tax payments.
Timing differences further influence outcomes. Companies can defer income recognition or accelerate expenses, temporarily reducing reported taxable profit.
Industry-specific rules benefit sectors such as technology, energy, and pharmaceuticals, each of which operates under unique tax structures.
Firms that previously recorded losses can offset future profits, sometimes reducing taxes for years after the initial downturn.

## 5. Key Insights from the Chart

One of the most striking discoveries is the enormous spread in effective tax rates. Some companies pay virtually nothing. Others pay 30–40% or more. This range demonstrates that corporate taxation is far from uniform.
Even companies within the same industry can differ dramatically. Two firms operating in similar markets may report very different effective rates depending on their accounting strategies, global footprint, and use of tax incentives.
The presence of negative effective tax rates is particularly notable. In some cases, firms receive net benefits from the government due to credits and deductions exceeding their tax liability.
Ultimately, the visualisation makes one conclusion clear: the statutory corporate tax rate does not reflect economic reality. Corporate tax payments depend heavily on accounting decisions, industry structure, international operations, and strategic tax planning, not simply on reported profit.
