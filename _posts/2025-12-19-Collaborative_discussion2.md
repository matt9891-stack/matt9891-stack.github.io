In today’s digital environment, where information flows easily across borders, protecting personal data has become increasingly important. Data privacy regulations aim to safeguard personal information while balancing individual rights with the use of data for innovation (Bakare et al., 2024). In response, the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 to harmonise data protection across Member States. After Brexit, the United Kingdom retained and adapted the GDPR framework, which came into effect in 2021, and closely follows the EU one while keeping the same core principles.

These frameworks require personal data to be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently, collected only when necessary for specific purposes, kept accurate and secure, retained for an appropriate period, and supported by organisational accountability (Newmark, 2025).

Under Article 32, which sets out rules for securing personal data, the EU controllers and processors deploy suitable technical and organisational protections appropriate to the risks of processing, considering the nature and scope of processing, implementation costs, and potential risks to individuals’ rights and freedoms. These measures include pseudonymisation, encryption, system resilience, data recovery, and regular testing, and compliance may be demonstrated through recognised certification schemes (GDPR, 2018).

Similarly, the UK GDPR uses a risk-based approach to data security, highlighting technical and organisational safeguards, ongoing checks, and proportionality. ICO guidance allows flexibility, and costs of implementation are considered in relation to the relative risk (ICO, 2023).

Key differences between the EU GDPR and UK GDPR involve jurisdiction, applicability, and regulatory oversight. The EU GDPR applies to all EU Member States and to organisations, even outside the EU, that process the data of individuals in the EU. In contrast, the UK GDPR applies within the United Kingdom and to organisations handling the personal data of individuals located in the UK (Halawi and Makwana, 2023). Supervisory oversight also differs, with the EU relying on national authorities guided by the European Data Protection Board, and the UK overseen by the Information Commissioner’s Office (Heydata.eu, 2025).

Consequently, organisations operating across both jurisdictions face challenges related to dual compliance obligations, emerging regulatory divergence, and complex cross-border data transfer requirements, which can be particularly demanding for organisations with limited resources or complex processing activities (GDPR Advisor, 2023). Both frameworks emphasise accountability through documentation, risk assessments, and governance measures.

In conclusion, while the EU and UK GDPR share core principles for data security, the UK GDPR closely aligns with the EU model, and particularly the UK regulator places strong emphasis on proportionate, risk-based implementation. This approach requires organisations to exercise careful judgement, which may lead to inconsistent implementation and pose additional challenges for smaller organisations seeking to maintain demonstrable compliance (ICO, 2023). Moreover, while this flexibility allows organisations to tailor measures to their specific context, it may also create uncertainty and gaps in enforcement, particularly for organisations without extensive legal or technical expertise. As such, the balance between adaptability and consistent protection of personal data remains a key challenge for regulators and organisations alike.
