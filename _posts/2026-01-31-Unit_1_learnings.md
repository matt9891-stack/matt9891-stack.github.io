## Unit 1: Data Visualisation for Machine Learning

Unit 1 introduced the fundamental importance of data visualisation and visual analytics in understanding and communicating complex information. 
A key insight from this unit is that visualisation is powerful because humans are naturally visual processors. 
The idea that “seeing is believing” reflects how effectively visuals communicate patterns, anomalies and relationships compared to raw numerical data. 
Research suggesting that a significant proportion of individuals are visual learners reinforces why visual analytics plays such a crucial role in decision-making and knowledge retention.

One of the most impactful examples explored was the Anscombe Quartet. Although the four datasets share nearly identical statistical properties (mean, variance, correlation and regression line), plotting them reveals entirely different distributions and relationships. 
This example critically demonstrates that relying solely on numerical summaries can be misleading. It reinforced the analytical principle that data must be visualised before a conclusion is reached. 
For me, this highlighted the importance of combining statistical reasoning with visual exploration rather than treating them as separate processes.

The unit also differentiated between explanatory (exhibitory) and exploratory visualisation. Explanatory visualisation focuses on communicating insights clearly to a defined audience, requiring awareness of audience knowledge, expectations and interpretation biases. 
In contrast, exploratory visualisation supports investigation and discovery, following principles such as Shneiderman’s mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand. This distinction helped me understand that visualisation is not only about aesthetics but about purpose and context. 
Visualisations can influence interpretation, meaning they are not entirely objective; design choices and audience perception shape them.

Another important learning outcome was understanding the relationship between data visualisation and business intelligence (BI). While data visualisation transforms raw data into graphical insights, BI systems manage, structure and analyse large volumes of business data to support strategic decisions. 
Data visualisation is therefore a component within BI rather than a replacement for it. 
Critically, this distinction clarified that dashboards and tools alone do not guarantee insight; data quality, appropriate metrics and contextual interpretation are equally important.

From a technical perspective, Unit 1 introduced different tools and programming environments used for data visualisation. Python was presented as particularly effective in machine learning contexts due to its scalable preprocessing capabilities and strong libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. My prior knowledge of Python was beneficial in understanding workflow concepts, data structures and plotting logic.

However, the introduction to R after Module 2 in numerical analysis presented challenges. Although both Python and R are widely used in data science, the syntactical differences between them made the transition less intuitive. My existing Python experience helped me understand programming logic, but R’s structure, functions and data handling conventions required adjustment. This experience highlighted an important learning curve: knowing one programming language does not automatically ensure fluency in another. It required me to adapt my thinking, particularly in relation to indexing, function syntax and package usage.

Critically reflecting, this challenge was valuable. It pushed me beyond my comfort zone and emphasised adaptability, an essential skill in data analytics. It also demonstrated that technical proficiency is not only about coding but about understanding analytical reasoning across different tools.
