# Collaborative Discussion

This collaborative discussion has been a valuable experience that allowed me to compare my research with different points of view and improve my understanding of data protection in the context of the EU and UK GDPR frameworks. 
Engaging with my peers’ responses helped me look beyond the legal comparison and consider broader aspect of the two regulamentation such as Jurisdictional and Technological.

I found very interesting the reflections on the gap between individuals’ awareness of privacy risks and their actual behaviour when sharing personal data, which adds an important societal perspective to regulatory effectiveness. 

The contributions also improved my analysis by highlighting practical  measures such as encryption and pseudonymisation.

Moreover, the discussion around AI and data protection, especially the need for clearer guidance and risk-aware implementation, highlighted how new technologies can challenge existing regulatory frameworks.

Overall, the exchange of ideas strengthened my original work and showed how combining legal, technical, and human perspectives.

Below my Initial and Summary Post

# Initial Post

In today’s digital environment, where information flows easily across borders, protecting personal data has become increasingly important. Data privacy regulations aim to safeguard personal information while balancing individual rights with the use of data for innovation (Bakare et al., 2024). In response, the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 to harmonise data protection across Member States. After Brexit, the United Kingdom retained and adapted the GDPR framework, which came into effect in 2021, and closely follows the EU one while keeping the same core principles.

These frameworks require personal data to be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently, collected only when necessary for specific purposes, kept accurate and secure, retained for an appropriate period, and supported by organisational accountability (Newmark, 2025).

Under Article 32, which sets out rules for securing personal data, the EU controllers and processors deploy suitable technical and organisational protections appropriate to the risks of processing, considering the nature and scope of processing, implementation costs, and potential risks to individuals’ rights and freedoms. These measures include pseudonymisation, encryption, system resilience, data recovery, and regular testing, and compliance may be demonstrated through recognised certification schemes (GDPR, 2018).

Similarly, the UK GDPR uses a risk-based approach to data security, highlighting technical and organisational safeguards, ongoing checks, and proportionality. ICO guidance allows flexibility, and costs of implementation are considered in relation to the relative risk (ICO, 2023).

Key differences between the EU GDPR and UK GDPR involve jurisdiction, applicability, and regulatory oversight. The EU GDPR applies to all EU Member States and to organisations, even outside the EU, that process the data of individuals in the EU. In contrast, the UK GDPR applies within the United Kingdom and to organisations handling the personal data of individuals located in the UK (Halawi and Makwana, 2023). Supervisory oversight also differs, with the EU relying on national authorities guided by the European Data Protection Board, and the UK overseen by the Information Commissioner’s Office (Heydata.eu, 2025).

Consequently, organisations operating across both jurisdictions face challenges related to dual compliance obligations, emerging regulatory divergence, and complex cross-border data transfer requirements, which can be particularly demanding for organisations with limited resources or complex processing activities (GDPR Advisor, 2023). Both frameworks emphasise accountability through documentation, risk assessments, and governance measures.

In conclusion, while the EU and UK GDPR share core principles for data security, the UK GDPR closely aligns with the EU model, and particularly the UK regulator places strong emphasis on proportionate, risk-based implementation. This approach requires organisations to exercise careful judgement, which may lead to inconsistent implementation and pose additional challenges for smaller organisations seeking to maintain demonstrable compliance (ICO, 2023). Moreover, while this flexibility allows organisations to tailor measures to their specific context, it may also create uncertainty and gaps in enforcement, particularly for organisations without extensive legal or technical expertise. As such, the balance between adaptability and consistent protection of personal data remains a key challenge for regulators and organisations alike.

# Summary Post

In my initial post, I discussed how the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR share the same core principles but differ in their practical application. Both the EU GDPR and UK GDPR require organisations to protect personal data using measures that match the level of risk, such as encryption, pseudonymisation, system resilience, and regular testing (GDPR, 2018). The post also highlights the differences in application of the 2 regulations, as the EU GDPR applies to all EU countries and even some organisations outside the EU if they handle data of EU citizens, while the UK GDPR only applies within the UK and to organisations handling data of people in the UK.

In this sense, Veli’s comment was extremely useful as it emphasised the challenges organisations face when complying with both frameworks, especially over cross-border data transfer, as UK GDPR and EU GDPR are considered two different jurisdictions (Heydata.eu, 2025). Francesca’s post focused, instead, on the different approach to the use of AI, while the EU GDPR does not mention Artificial Intelligence (Sartor and Lagioia, 2020, pp.1–84), the UK GDPR provides clearer guidance that mentions principles such as algorithmic fairness, Special Category Data & Inferences and Transparency and Explainability.

In conclusion, while the EU GDPR and UK GDPR share the same core principles, their practical application differs. The UK GDPR offers more practical guidance, particularly through the ICO, which helps organisations manage risks and emerging technologies like AI, while operating across both frameworks can be challenging due to differences in jurisdiction, oversight, and cross-border requirements.
