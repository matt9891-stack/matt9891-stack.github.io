# About

Hi, nice to meet you.

My journey into the world of technology began in 2020, when I took my first step into data analysis by completing an Excel course to enhance my analytical and forecasting skills. As I explored Excel’s capabilities, I quickly recognised the need for more dynamic ways to access, analyse, and share data across teams. This curiosity led me to study SQL and Google Looker, where I built interactive dashboards that provided key insights into departmental trends and best-selling products for the store I managed.

Over the next two years, my passion for technology and data-driven decision-making continued to grow. To deepen my expertise, I enrolled in a Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I strengthened my skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau—transforming data into actionable insights and meaningful visual stories.

Today, with a solid foundation in data analytics and hands-on experience in retail management, I’m eager to embark on my career as a Data Analyst. I’m passionate about leveraging data to drive strategic decisions, optimise performance, and uncover growth opportunities.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring a diverse set of transferable competencies from my background in management and retail—such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving—that I continue to apply and refine in every project I undertake.
